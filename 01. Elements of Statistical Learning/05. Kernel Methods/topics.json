        "Kernel smoothing is a class of regression techniques that estimates the regression function f(X) by fitting simple models locally at each query point x\u2080. This involves using observations close to the target point, achieved through a weighting function or kernel K\u03bb(x\u2080, xi) that assigns weights based on distance, with \u03bb dictating the neighborhood's width. Kernel methods primarily serve as a device for localization, differing from their use in regularized nonlinear modeling, where kernels compute an inner product in a high-dimensional feature space. These methods require minimal training, with most computations performed at evaluation time.",
        "One-dimensional kernel smoothers estimate the regression function E(Y|X = x) by computing a weighted average in a neighborhood of the target point, assigning weights that decrease smoothly with distance to avoid discontinuity. The Nadaraya-Watson kernel-weighted average is a common method that achieves this continuity. The Epanechnikov quadratic kernel is used to give more weight to points closer to the target, resulting in a continuous and smooth fitted function, where points enter the neighborhood with weight zero and their contribution increases gradually. One-dimensional kernel smoothers can also use the k-nearest-neighbor average as an estimate of the regression function, relaxing the definition of conditional expectation.",
        "Local linear regression addresses the bias of locally-weighted averages, especially at domain boundaries, by fitting straight lines rather than constants locally, removing the bias to first order. This involves solving a separate weighted least squares problem at each target point x\u2080, minimizing \u03a3i K\u03bb(x\u2080, xi)[yi - \u03b1(x\u2080) - \u03b2(x\u2080)xi]\u00b2. The estimate is linear in y: f(x\u2080) = \u03a3i li(x\u2080)yi, where li(x\u2080) combines the kernel and least squares operations. This approach effectively corrects for asymmetry in the kernel and is sometimes referred to as automatic kernel carpentry.",
        "Local polynomial regression extends local linear fits by fitting local polynomial fits of any degree d, where the bias will only have components of degree d+1 and higher, but with a price of increased variance. This involves minimizing \u03a3i K\u03bb(x\u2080, xi)[yi - \u03b1(x\u2080) - \u03a3j \u03b2j(x\u2080)xi^j]\u00b2, reducing bias further but potentially increasing variance. Asymptotic analysis suggests odd-degree polynomials dominate even-degree ones.",
        "Selecting the width of the kernel (parameter \u03bb) involves balancing bias and variance. A narrow window results in high variance and low bias, while a wide window results in low variance and high bias. Larger \u03bb implies lower variance but higher bias, while smaller \u03bb implies higher variance but lower bias. Metric window widths maintain constant bias but have variance inversely proportional to local density, whereas nearest-neighbor window widths keep variance constant but have bias varying inversely with local density. Cross-validation techniques, such as leave-one-out, generalized, Cp, or k-fold, are used to determine the optimal smoothing parameter. The effective degrees of freedom, defined as trace(Sx), are used to calibrate the amount of smoothing, where Sx is the smoother matrix built up from the equivalent kernels.",
        "Kernel smoothing and local regression generalize to two or more dimensions, fitting a constant or hyperplane locally with weights supplied by a p-dimensional kernel, often a radial function like the Epanechnikov or tri-cube kernel. Boundary effects are exacerbated in higher dimensions, making boundary correction via local polynomial regression crucial. Standardizing predictors to unit standard deviation is crucial due to the Euclidean norm's sensitivity to coordinate units.",
        "Structured kernels modify the kernel by using a positive semidefinite matrix A to weigh different coordinates, downgrading or omitting entire coordinates or directions by imposing restrictions on A. This can be expressed as K\u03bb,A(x\u2080, x) = D((x - x\u2080)\u1d40A(x - x\u2080) / \u03bb\u00b2), where the covariance function of predictors can tailor A to focus less on high-frequency contrasts. Structured regression functions, such as additive models and ANOVA decompositions, reduce dimensionality by eliminating higher-order interaction terms and using iterative backfitting algorithms.",
        "Mixture models, particularly Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), are useful for density estimation and can be viewed as a kind of kernel method. A GMM is formed with mixing proportions and each Gaussian density has a mean and covariance matrix, represented as f(x) = \u03a3m \u03b1m \u03c6(x; \u03bcm, \u03a3m). These parameters are typically fit by maximum likelihood using the EM algorithm. When covariance matrices are constrained to be scalar, the model has the form of a radial basis expansion.",
        "The computational cost to fit at a single observation is O(N) flops, but popular implementations of local regression use triangulation schemes to reduce the computations. They compute the fit exactly at M carefully chosen locations (O(NM)), and then use blending techniques to interpolate the fit elsewhere (O(M) per evaluation). Smoothing parameters are typically determined offline using cross-validation, incurring a cost of O(N\u00b2).",

Using Bayes' theorem with separate mixture densities in each class leads to flexible models for Pr(G|X), allowing for classification based on the probability that an observation belongs to a component. The mixture model provides an estimate of the probability that observation i belongs to component m, and can be used for classification by thresholding each value rij and comparing the classification of each observation by CHD and the mixture model."
